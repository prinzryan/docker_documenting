## Docker Image
In Docker World, In order to make a Container, you need Image.
<br />

Container is instance of Image. As in, you make a Object from the Class, in programming term. Imagine that Container is Object. and Image is Class.
First fo all, you need to download image to your local machine (maybe in certain folder) . In order to do it, there is simple command line in terminal.

{% highlight terminal %}
~$ docker pull nginx:1.12.2-alpine
// docker pull <imageName:tag>
{% endhighlight %}

Place you can search images is called Docker Hub.
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) - Find out what image you want to use and it's versions.

Afer you download images, you can check using this command. : `docker images`
{% highlight terminal %}
~$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
nginx               1.12.2-alpine       24ed1c575f81        4 days ago          15.5MB
~$

{% endhighlight %}

If you want to delete Images : `docker rmi -f nginx:1.12.2-alpine` (`docker rmi -f <imageName:Tag>`)
`rmi` = remove images
